effect calculus

[x : τ = e] y

handling an effect x with type τ and handler e scoped to y

λ x . y

is shorthand for an operation requiring an operation x which produces a value. i.e.

λ x . y  ~~>  [x = _] y

an application like `f a` is shorthand for supplying such an operation. i.e.

f a  ~~>  [x = a] f
